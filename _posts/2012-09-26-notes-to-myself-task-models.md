  MBUI &#8211; Task Models
</p>

<p>
  Task models are useful when designing and developing interactive systems. They describe the logical activities that have to be carried out in order to reach the userâ€™s goals. This document covers the specification of Task Models, with a meta-model expressed in UML, and an XML Schema that can be used as the basis for interchange of Task Models between different user interface development tools.
