<a id="jive-54572178099325815373" href="https://community.jboss.org/people/cvasilak" data-externalid="" data-username="cvasilak" data-avatarid="-1">Christos Vasilakis</a> has just published his iPhone app for JBossAS 7. It currently supports the following features:

> **Subsystem Metrics Monitoring  
> **The metrics currently exposed are for Configuration, JVM, Data Sources, JMS Destinations, Transactions and Web subsystems (similar to those shown in the JBoss built-in web console).
> 
> **Deployments Management  
> **You can upload an artifact (installed on your iPhone through iTunes file sharing mechanism) and then enable/disable it on the server.
> 
> **Browse the management tree  
> **The whole management tree is exposed for you to configure, similar to the JBoss-cli {-gui} tool provided by the server. You can easily modify attributes and execute operations. Documentation of attributes and operation parameters (as provided by the JBoss 7 server) is easily accessed for you to refer.

Congrats to the first release Chistos. Great job!
