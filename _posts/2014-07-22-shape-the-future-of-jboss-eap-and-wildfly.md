We are currently working to improve the usability and information architecture of the web-based admin console. By taking part in a short exercise you will help us better understand how users interpret the information and accomplish their goals.

You do not need to be an expert of the console to participate in this study. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The activity shouldnâ€™t take longer than 10 to 15 minutes to complete</span>.

To start participating in the study, click on the link below and follow the instructions.
