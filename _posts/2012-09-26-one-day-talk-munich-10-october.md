Like in 2011 a large number of globally renowned speakers from Europe and the U.S. will come together to present their practical knowledge, to report on project experiences and to provide you with the latest developments in software technology around Java EE and JBoss. The broad-based range of topics aims not only at software developers and architects, but project managers and IT decision makers are also provided with valuable information by leading JBoss project leads and core developers.

[We are looking forward to see you on the conference!][2]
