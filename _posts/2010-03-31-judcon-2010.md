JUDCon is an event by developers, for developers. Presentations will include a range of deep technical dives into JBoss Community projects and related technical topics of developer interest. The inaugural JUDCon will be a one day event packed with valuable sessions and will run into the early hours of the following day. For your convenience, JUDCon is the day before JBoss World and shares the same venue. In the future, look for stand-alone, multi-day events.
