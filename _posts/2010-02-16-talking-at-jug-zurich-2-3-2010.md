I&#8217;ll be talking about GWT and project Errai in particular at the Java User Group Zurich at the 2.3.2010:

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Patterns and Best Practices for building large GWT applications</span>

<span style="font-style:italic;">In this presentation we?ll see how to organize a nontrivial GWT application. We?ll go through the lessons learned in a real world project and take a look the complete development lifecycle and best practices that go beyond what GWT has to offer out-of-the- box. This talk does focus on modularity of GWT applications and how to overcome the burdens of compile-time linking. We?ll talk about client side patterns and server side implementation options and explore different approaches that allow for quick turn around times without sacrificing maintainability.</p> 

<p>
  As part of this talk we&#8217;ll look at project Errai (<a href="http://jboss.org/errai">http://jboss.org/errai</a>) and <br />see how it can help to achieve these tasks.</span>

  In case you are around, make sure to show up.
