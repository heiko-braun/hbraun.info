I&#8217;ll speaking in Munich next monday (12.04):

In this presentation we&#8217;ll see how to organize a nontrivial GWT application. We&#8217;ll go through the lessons learned in a real world project and take a look the complete development lifecycle and best practices that go beyond what GWT has to offer out-of-the-box. This talk does focus on modularity of GWT applications and how to overcome the burdens of compile-time linking. We&#8217;ll talk about client side patterns and server side implementation options and explore different approaches that allow for quick turn around times without sacrificing maintainability.
